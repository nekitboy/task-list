# Refactor of TaskList project

1. Task class was without any testing, so firstly we add tests (`TaskTest.java`) for Task.java

1. Declare `Project` instance which could contain `Task`s, and write tests (`ProjectTest.java`)

1. We realize that `nextId` (which generates Id for tasks) from `TaskList` is not part of TaskList. So we move it's implementation to `Task.java` as static method. We add ability to create Tasks without specifying id, to it be autoGenerated. Write tests for `nextId` and creation task without specifying id

1. Declare `App.java` to run Task Application (`TaskList`).

1. Action factory added. Now we can easily add new actions.

1. Abstract class `Action`.

1. Work with the console moved to `Console` class

1. `delete <id>` command added

1. `deadline <id> <date in format YYYY-DD-MM>` command added

1. `today` command added
